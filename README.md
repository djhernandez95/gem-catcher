Super Gem Catcher

You play the role of an adventurer who has found themselves in a magical cave, rumored to once be the home of a powerful wizard. Deep within its tunnels, they come across an enchanted room where gems drop from the ceiling! 
Eager to strike it rich, the adventurer scrambles to catch as many as they can. 
The room has some powerful protection, however â€“ if five gems touch the ground, then a powerful wave of magic will force the adventurer out of the cave. 
How many gems can they catch before they are forced out?

Originally developed for a class project, Super Gem Catcher is enhanced with larger sprites and a proper heads up display for tracking lives and scores. More enhancements to come!

Controls
A: move left
D: move right

Collect gems for as long as you can! Touch a gem to collect it.
After 50 gems are collected, they fall at a faster rate.
Let 5 touch the ground, and it's game over.
Good luck!

Works best at 15 Cycles/Frame, but try 20 for a faster, tougher mode of play.
