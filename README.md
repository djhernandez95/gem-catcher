Super Gem Catcher
====
Originally developed for a class project, Super Gem Catcher is a simple game developed in [Octo](http://johnearnest.github.io/Octo/), an assembler for the [Chip8](http://mattmik.com/chip8.html) virtual machine by John Earnest. Compared to the original Gem Catcher (which is also included), this version is enhanced with a higher resolution, new Game Over screen, and a proper heads up display for tracking lives and scores. More enhancements to come!

You play the role of an adventurer who has found themselves in a magical cave, rumored to once be the home of a powerful wizard. Deep within its tunnels, they come across an enchanted room where gems drop from the ceiling! 
Eager to strike it rich, the adventurer scrambles to catch as many as they can. The room has some powerful protection, however â€“ if five gems touch the ground, then a powerful wave of magic will force the adventurer out of the cave. 
How many gems can they catch before they are forced out?

The controls are simple: press A to move left and D to move right.
Your goal is to collect gems for as long as you can! Touch a gem to collect it. To help, the adventurer can wrap around the screen, letting you reach faraway gems more easily.
After 50 gems are collected, they fall at a faster rate.
Let 5 touch the ground, and it's game over. Good luck!

Works best at 15 Cycles/Frame, but try 20 for a faster, tougher mode of play.
